MODEL ANALYSIS
==============

Random Forest Performance:
- Test Accuracy: 0.8306
- Test Macro F1: 0.8070
- Best Parameters: {'class_weight': 'balanced', 'max_depth': 30, 'min_samples_split': 5, 'n_estimators': 200}

Why Random Forest works well for this task:
1. Ensemble of trees reduces overfitting on small dataset
2. Handles high-dimensional TF-IDF features effectively
3. Built-in feature importance for interpretability
4. Balanced class weights handle the imbalanced classes

Note: Transformer model (task6_transformer.py) provides deep learning comparison.
